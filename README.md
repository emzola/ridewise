# RideWise: Ride-Hailing App

RideWise is a ride-hailing application that connects passengers with nearby drivers for convenient and efficient transportation.  Users can easily request rides by specifying their pickup and drop-off locations, with the application employing sophisticated matching algorithms to pair them with available drivers based on factors like proximity, destination, and driver ratings. Real-time tracking functionalities allow passengers to monitor their driver's location and estimated time of arrival, ensuring a seamless and transparent experience. Cashless transactions are facilitated through integrated payment gateways, and users can rate and review drivers to maintain service quality. An intuitive admin dashboard provides oversight, allowing administrators to manage users, drivers, rides, and resolve disputes, while an analytics service offers insights into key metrics for performance optimization.
